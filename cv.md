## About Me
I realized a long time ago that I wanted to get into IT. I tried myself in different areas: 
* Web design 
* Manual testing (I completed courses) 
* Python 
* 3D modeling 

And at that moment I decided to try myself in front-end development. I studied independently on YouTube, studied courses on Udemy and over time I realized that I wanted to develop in this direction.

Currently I work as a teacher of mathematics, physics and computer science.
